subtitle: There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that.

My name is Alan Cheng. I have the following qualities:

- I love machine learning!
- I'm extremely loyal to my family！
- I'm a machine that don't pass the Turing test until one day you make my heart smile!



### My story
```
8.26 = 0.7 × |3-1-4| × 5.9,

9.18 = 2.7 × |6-0-5| × 3.4,

The first time I knew LOVE,

9 * 856 = 3 * 24 * 107, 

which is my TRUTH!
```
