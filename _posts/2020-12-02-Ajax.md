## Introduction
Ajax, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Ajax requests are by default asynchronous, which means you must have callbacks that will handle the data from a response. Callback methods are passed in the options hash when making a request:
```javascript
new Ajax.Request('/some_url', {
  method:'get',
  onSuccess: function(transport) {
    var response = transport.responseText || "no response text";
    alert("Success! \n\n" + response);
  },
  onFailure: function() { alert('Something went wrong...'); }
});

<!-- This is the mechanism of javascript>

<!-- Prototype takes the complexity out of client-side web programming. Built to solve real-world problems, it adds useful extensions to the browser scripting environment and provides elegant APIs around the clumsy interfaces of Ajax and the Document Object Model.>


```
The transport for Ajax requests is XmlHttpRequest, we can get the content of response from transport.responseText. It is just similar to Python's `requests` which is contain the request to server and the response from server.

```javascript
var xmlhttp;
if(window.XMLHttpRequest){
    // code for IE7+ Firefox Chrome Opera Safari
    xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
}else{
    xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsofe.XMLHTTP");
}
xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function(){  //1 
    if(xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
    {
        document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;//2 3
    }
}
xmlhttp.open("POST","/ajax/",true);
xmlhttp.send();

```
There are three steps to finish the update of web by javascript.Firstly, set the monitor and request. Second, parse the content of response. Third, change the content in the Web.
