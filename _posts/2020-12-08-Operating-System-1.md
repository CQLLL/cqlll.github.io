## Foreword and acknowledgments

xv6 is modeled on Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6(v6). xv6 is loosely follows the structure and style of 
v6, but is implemented in ANSI C for a multi-core RISC-V.(基于精简指令集(RISC)原则的开源指令集架构(ISA)) Now Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006, which we ported(移植) xv6 to RISC-V for a new undergraduate class 6.S081.
This operating system, xv6, provides the basic interfaces introduced by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie’s Unix operating system, as well as mimicking Unix’s internal design.
