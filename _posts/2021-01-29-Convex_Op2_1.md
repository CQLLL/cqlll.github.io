[任意仿射集合都可以表示为一个线性方程组的解集](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2812843/every-affine-set-can-be-expressed-as-the-solution-set-of-a-system-of-linear-equa)

Assume C≠∅ (otherwise it is trivial A=0, b=1). We are to show that there exist A, b such that

Ax=b⟺x∈C.


Step 1: Take any x0∈C (exists as C≠∅) and consider
C0={z:z=x−x0, x∈C}.
Claim 1 says that it is an easy exercise that C affine iff C0 linear (subspace). To work with a subspace is easier as now instead of searching for A, b that Ax=b we can search for simply A such that


A(x−x0)=0⟺x−x0∈C0.


If we manage to find such A then we are done (just choose b=Ax0).

Step 2: How to find such A? Every subspace C0 in Rn is complementable, so there exists a subspace C⊥0 (orthogonal complement to C0) such that C0⊥C⊥0 and C0+C⊥0=Rn. It means that


z∈C0⟺z⊥a, ∀a∈C⊥0.



In words, vectors in C0 are those and exactly those that are orthogonal to all vectors in C⊥0.

Now let {a1,…,ak} be a basis of C⊥0. Then
z⊥a, ∀a∈C⊥0⟺z⊥ai, i=1,…,k,⟺aTiz=0, ∀i=1,…,k.
If we define a matrix A with rows being aTi then the last orthogonality condition is precisely


Az=0.


Step 3: Now recall that z∈C0 iff z=x−x0, x∈C, that is we have found A such that


A(x−x0)=0⟺x−x0∈C0⟺x∈x0+C0=C.


To finish, set Ax0=b and conclude that


Ax=b⟺x∈C.
